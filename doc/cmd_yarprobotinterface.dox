\section yarprobotinterface_intro Description

The yarprobotinterface is a command line tool that is useful to launch multiple YARP device at once.

Its name derives from the fact that the first and main use of the yarprobotinterface was used as the
main program to provide a network "interface", via YARP Network Server Wrappers (NWS) devices, to a robot.

However, the yarprobotinterface can be used to launch YARP devices of any kind. In a sense, is an extension of the
yarpdev command, that instead can be used only to launch one or two devices, while yarprobotinterface can launch an
arbitrary number of YARP devices.

The details of the xml format of the files loaded by yarprobotinterface are documented in \ref yarp_robotinterface_xml_config_files .
